This beautiful art of Volunteering is important because it enable individuals to help others in a selfless way. Volunteering is one of the most challenging and rewarding opportunity that one will ever encounter. It gives the chances to bring a change in the people around. Ashakiranam Cancer Care Campaign has been providing numerous changes in the community through the magic of spirit of Volunteerism. Volunteerism is a way of giving back to the community while also developing essential social skills and gaining valuable experiences. That’s the reason Caritas India considered Volunteering as one of her strategic Pillar. Ashakiranam Dress Bank is one of the volunteers initiative by Wayanad Social Service Society. This model of cancer patients support programme has been functioning for the past 2 years in the Mananthavady Diocese. This is a humanitarian venture in extending supportive hands through Ashakiranam women Volunteers. This endeavour provides dresses primarily to poor cancer patients and needy community people. These dresses are congregated from different houses which are serviceable and not useable for them and kept in a separate room in WSSS. All the women volunteers made this act a routine in a monthly schedule. 1300 Ashakiranam Volunteers are engaged in cancer care activities of WSSS to reduce the spread of cancer and support cancer patients. The thought of Ashakiranam Dress Bank emerged by the volunteers in their volunteering filed work by realizing the very fact many poor people in the community lack proper clothing especially in the tribal belts. The idea of Ashakiranam Dress back was approved by the DSSS Director in one the Resource Team meeting that conduct every quarter for planning the future activities for volunteers. A room was set to keep the clothing the volunteers mobilized from the community. “Ashakiranam Dress Bank is truly a need-based interventions of WSSS under Ashakiranam campaign and we see a good number of people come and get the benefit of the noble initiative and it has become one the milestone achievement of WSSS” says Rev. Fr. Paul Koottala, Executive Director, Wayanad Social Service Society. There is a log book kept in the Dress bank to understand and record the volume of support extending by this initiative. Any needy person can come and take the clothing according to the requirement and mention the number of clothing in the logbook. In the same manner if any person wishes to contribute, they can also freely approach and keep the clothing in the dress bank marking in the logbook. The logbook shows the quantity of clothing collected from the community and distribute among poor with this campaign. The volunteers visit and hand over the dress to sick cancer patients. “For the past 2 years with the support of Volunteers thousand of usable dresses were collected and distributed. Every month volunteers bring cloths from their operational areas and expanding these services to more poor people” says Rev. Fr. Jinoj Palathadathil, Associate Ex. Director, WSSS. Volunteers Play vital role in mobilizing the dress from the community. Volunteers show their happiness to be engaged in this caring service. “I feel very happy and joy by getting the opportunity to help those in need. The people are donating with positive and happy mind, this in a way making changes in me and motivating me to involve more in this act” said by Mrs Shoba Edayoorkunnu while handing over the mobilized clothing to the Dress Bank. During the pandemic season, the Dress Bank became a great relief to a good number of people who have struggled with Covid related unemployment and lockdown. These days, the noble initiative is appreciated by many people and the leading Medias covered the news content. There are also more people who are kind enough to donate their serviceable dresses to the poor and become partakers in the comprehensible service of WSSS.\")]),a(\"h6\",{staticClass:\"text-success\"},[e._v(\"2022-01-25 11:08:26\")])])]),a(\"div\",{staticClass:\"col-md-6\"},[a(\"div\",{staticStyle:{display:\"flex\",gap:\"10px\",\"justify-content\":\"center\"}},[a(\"img\",{staticStyle:{width:\"49%\"},attrs:{src:\"https://wsssindia.in/storage/news/photo1643108906.jpg\"}})])])]),a(\"div\",{staticClass:\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\"},[a(\"hr\")])]),a(\"div\",{staticClass:\"col-12 span-12\"},[a(\"div\",{staticClass:\"row\"},[a(\"div\",{staticClass:\"col-md-6 sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\"},[a(\"div\",{staticClass:\"sqs-block-content\"},[a(\"h2\",{staticStyle:{\"font-size\":\"20px\"}},[a(\"span\",{staticClass:\"sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent\"},[e._v(\"MEDICAL KIT DISTRIBUTION.\")])]),a(\"p\",[e._v(\"Medical kits were distributed with the financial assistance of Caritas India, Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council, Syro-Malabar Diocese Melbourne Australia and the Catholic Mission as part of Covid prevention activities.
